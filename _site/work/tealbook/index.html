      I was employed by Tealbook to be their Product Lead. That meant understanding their market, users and vision for their product and pushing them forward with the next instalment of Tealbook.
    </h2>
    <p class="ma0 f4 fw4 lh-copy pt4">
      With the first product already launched I was able to understand the direction they had already taken and spoke to their existing user base. I was able to gather feedback about the current application and understand the frustrations and needs users had at the moment.
      <br>
      <br>
      Through user interviews I was able to formulate reports that dug into concerns of the current application and ways we could prioritize moving forward.

    <p class="ma0 f4 lh-copy">
      Amidst this, we had an entirely new team. Nobody was aligned on what goals were and who users were. Team members needed to understand what our exectuvies priorities were from the beginnig so we could successfully re-write an entire application and properly prioritize user stories.
      <br>
      <br>
      To remedy this we ran a Design Sprint to understand key goals, concerns, key end users and journey mapping session.

      Understanding our supplier users

  <div class="w-70-l w-100 pl5-l">
    <p class="ma0 f4 lh-copy">
      Through these exercises we were able to start prioritizing what stories needed more attention for each type of user. Both the Key End Users section and Journey Map highlighted key points in the application that were failing or key points that we could truly capitalize on to make the biggest impact. We created two maps to outline this since this is a dual user system.
      <br>
      <br>
      The Key User takeaways allowed us to see that suppliers are most worried about several things when using Tealbook. That is: generating leads and the ability to differentiate themselves. We noticed through the journey map walkthrough that sign up was also a burden for these users along with inputing information in their profile. These felt like easy ways to start making an instant impact so we started prioritizing these features first.

      This is a user signup concept and breakdown in order to help fill in just enough information for the supplier profile. This preliminary sketch was used to help pick which questions needed to be asked.
      <br>
      <br>
      After breaking down all the information we went straight to prototyping the signup. This helped us get and MVP done fairly quickly and reduce the time for feedback.
