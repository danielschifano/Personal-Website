      The Problem
    </h2>
    <p class="ma0 f4 fw4 lh-copy pt4">
      Thyssenkrupp came to Rangle so we could help replace their current mechanic assistant application. This current product operated on an old Palm Pilot device and allowed mechanics to debrief all the work they do during the day. In order to use this product mechanics had to read a large 165pg booklet and complete onsite testing.
      <br>
      <br>
      Before approaching Rangle.io, Thyssenkrupp Elevator had commissioned a design firm to create interface designs based off of a requirement booklet that was signed off by upper management. This imposed a large risk because many of these high fidelity mockups were created based off of assumption that the user could successfully use all the features proposed in the first place.
      <br>
      <br>
      Our goal was to minimize that flow and focus on testing with users to ensure that mechanics could complete their daily tasks in a timely manner. We wanted to reduce our risk by validating the assumptions made during designing the mockups.

    <p class="ma0 f4 lh-copy">
      My role for the length of the engagement was to consult on whether the designs would work and help build out interfaces with the product team so we could speed up development. During the process of examining the high fidelity mockups presented there were many unanswered questions that were risen by the product team. Many sections needed a complete redesign and some parts of the product that depended so heavily on user success needed to be tested. I took it upon myself to help the product team get the product to point where we could test with a set of users and carry out an iterative approach to usability testing to get a solid feedback loop started.

      Testing Summary

    <p class="ma0 f4 lh-copy">
      Once we had a stable build of the application we decided to conduct usability tests. Participants would try to complete tasks while observers watch, listen and takes notes. The goal was to identify any usability problems, collect qualitative and quantitative metrics and determine the participant's satisfaction with the product.
      <br>
      <br>
      Upon completion of the survey and the analyzation of the usability test results we found key areas within the product that we could improve upon and have validated others user flows which have done exceptionally well. The majority of the concerns fell within the area of an employee adding a work description and a debrief. These concerns all had one attribute in common, they lack giving the user enough visual feedback when completing a task.
      <br>
      <br>
      Aside from these concerns, the areas in which we tested the application have done generally well and many of the recommendations were easy to moderate in difficulty.

      Methodology
    </h2>
  </div>
  <div class="w-70-l w-100 pl5-l">
    <p class="ma0 f4 lh-copy">
      During the usability evaluation, six participants, matching the TKE mechanic user profile, were asked to complete several tasks within the application. During this time, participants:
      <br>
      <br>
      1. Completed a user background questionnaire
      <br>
      2. Performed real-world tasks on the application while thinking aloud
      <br>
      3. Answered questions after every task
      <br>
      4. Answered questions about their overall satisfaction upon completion of all their tasks.
      <br>
      <br>
      During the usability evaluation, participants were asked to complete sixteen (16) scenarios or “real-life” tasks on the site. The tasks were presented in a specific order and participants were instructed to read the scenario and complete the task.
      <br>
      <br>
      We collected two types of metrics, Performance and Preference based. The Performance based metrics we captured were Scenario Completion and Scenario Completion Time. Scenario Completion is when the participant indicates the scenario's goal has been obtained (whether successfully or unsuccessfully) or the participant requests and receives sufficient guidance as to warrant scoring the scenario as a critical error. Scenario Completion Time is the time to complete each scenario, not including subjective evaluation durations, will be recorded.
      <br>
      <br>
      The Preference based metrics collected were from Subjective Evaluations. Subjective evaluations regarding ease of use and satisfaction were collected via questionnaires, and during debriefing at the conclusion of the session. The questionnaires utilize free-form responses and rating scales.
      <br>
      <br>
      Participants were recorded with an iPhone 6 Plus. This allowed for the gathering and evaluation of the tester’s audio and facial expressions. The participants were also recorded with a GoPro camera that was connected to the iPhone 6 Plus they were testing with. This recorded both audio and visual data.

      Outcome
    </h2>

  <div class="w-70-l w-100 pl5-l">
    <p class="ma0 f4 lh-copy">
      Once we had a stable build of the application we decided to conduct usability tests. Participants We found that mechanics could easily complete tasks within the product and were already doing it faster in comparison to what they had been currently using. The majority of users had shaved about 5-10 minutes off the time they currently take to debrief their work during the day. The amount of billable work hours saved during the year across over three thousand employees equates to a large sum of operational costs. Continuing to iterate and make changes within our sprints would go on to save Thyssenkrupp Elevator a fair amount in operational costs.
