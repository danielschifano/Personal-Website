      About Me
    </h2>
    <p class="ma0 f4 fw4 lh-copy pt3">
      I am enthusiastic and passionate about designing innovative, engaging products that deliver both business value and a great experience for users. As and advocate for agile and lean UX, I believe that great products and user experiences depends on collaboration and communication. I ensure that throughout the design process there is collaboration with my peers, across teams, departments and stakeholders.
      <br>
      <br>
      My approach to design is iterative, flexible and open-minded. I am comfortable sketching concepts collaboratively with the team during a sprint and working independently to produce interactive prototypes; working on high-level strategy and planning, or finalizing the details of a design – and all stages in between.

      The Truth About Usability Testing and Agile
      <br>
      April 2016
      <br>
      In this talk, I examined the big questions professionals have about how to incorporate usability testing within the Agile development cycle. From formulating a massive usability report a er a two-day testing session in Texas, to lightweight candid testing with immediate feedback for validation, I used examples from my work at Rangle.io to discuss the depths of exploration and the learning outcomes from each approach.

      Usability Testing: Solving Problems Before They Are Problems
      <br>
      January 2016
      <br>
      In this talk, I taught the audience about the basics of conducting a formal usability test. I used examples of conducting tests with a large enterprise client and elaborated on the outcomes from that process.
