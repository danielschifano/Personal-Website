    The Problem
  </h2>
  <p class="ma0 f4 lh-copy">
    The Vitamin Shoppe’s mission is to help people achieve their health and wellness goals. For a company that has been in business since 1977 they continue to do their best to serve their user base as best as they can. When The Vitamin Shoppe contacted Rangle they had several issues with their online store that needed deeper attention. The larger issue was that their internal stakeholders couldn’t had issues coming together to form an action plan.

    Team & Role
  </h2>
  <p class="ma0 f4 lh-copy">
    I was brought onto the project to consult with key internal stakeholders on an action plan for the next phase of product development. I had a small team of developers and support as once we decided on a plan, our team would aid their internal development team  in the execution.  Before we could start we needed to understand what our highest priority goal was for the next production release.

    Kickoff & Discovery
  </h2>
  <p class="ma0 f4 lh-copy">
    We began running some kickoff exercises to understand who our internal and external stakeholders were and what they wanted to achieve. Firstly we wanted to understand what our goals for the engagement were. I had every participant jot down on stickies what they understood the goal of the engagement to be. Once finished they would converge and map notes that belonged together so they could vote on which goals would be a highest priority.
    <br>
    <br>
    There were many apparent concerns for the current website which led to several long discussions about the reasoning behind each. After voting it was apparent that there were several problems with the current checkout flow. It hadn’t been updated in years and it currently took 9 steps from the moment a user added an item to the cart to full checkout. Although there was pushback from other internal stakeholders it was unanimous that this was the highest priority.

    Target Users
  </h2>
  <p class="ma0 f4 lh-copy">
    Aside from prioritizing the checkout user experience I wanted the internal stakeholders to lay out what their goals and concerns for this engagement were. This exercise further instilled a sense of alignment amongst each other, including our product team. Although some stakeholders were more concerned with the technical performance of the impending solution every single stakeholder wanted to make sure that the solution was streamlined and had the best possible experience for their user base. This further instilled within the team that the priority of checkout was very high in comparison to other features discussed.
    <br>
    <br>
    We also took the opportunity for the internal stakeholders to come together to discuss who their target users are for The Vitamin Shoppe website. Although this didn’t inherently affect which goals we wanted to prioritize this exercise helped our product team understand who we were catering too when tackling the checkout experience. We knew that the majority of their web users would be experienced customers that they had retained so a personalized experience could really help to keep retention high and also connect and enhance other portions of the website. This included and was not limited to checkout, user profile and item search.

    Design Process
  </h2>
  <p class="ma0 f4 lh-copy">
    We began by working closely with The Vitamin Shoppe’s internal UX Manager. This included the rebuild of the checkout information architecture and the beginning of wireframes. Our goal was to not only rebuild checkout to be a much more smoother and quicker experience but to also try and incorporate some features that would enhance the experience for our loyal customers. These wireframes would help our product team understand what needed to be done and allowed us to test and validate any assumptions we had about our proposed solution.
