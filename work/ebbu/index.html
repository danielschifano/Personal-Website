    The Problem
  </h2>
  <p class="ma0 f5 fw4 lh-paragraph">
    Originally, Ebbu was Mediaowl, a sentiment tracking tool that allowed users to search and analyze the media's sentiment towards certain events. The further we delved into the research of sentiment the more we knew that it would be too complicated to create a system that would understand and comprehend the english language.
    <br>
    <br>
    Moving forward we wanted to keep what we thought made Mediaowl so special: giving users interesting and valuable information.

    Team & Role
  </h2>
  <p class="ma0 f5 fw4 lh-paragraph">
    I worked closely with the founder of Ebbu to understand why the previous version of Ebbu had failed and how we could learn from those mistakes to create a much more delightful user experience and much more maintainable product.

    Design Output
  </h2>
  <p class="ma0 f5 fw4 lh-paragraph">
    The original concept for Ebbu was built upon allowing users to search what the sentiment was for their desired topic. The ability to view journalists that wrote negatively or positively about an issue, being able to explore top positive and negative articles, and the ability to compare the sentiment of a search to another are just some of the features that Mediaowl would provide. We went back to the drawing board, conducting a competitive analysis and user interviews to decide what would help us make a better product for our users.
    <br>
    <br>
    Through storyboards and wireframes we were able to explore different options and eliminate others. Wireframes allowed us to visually communicate abstract concepts with users and team members to generate crucial feedback. Ebbu was becoming the scalable and unique application that we wanted to create. Through rapid prototyping, we got users involved early in the design process with quick prototypes. We uncovered usability issues and validated design decisions based on actual user reactions.

    Sharing articles is one of the main draws of using a product like Ebbu. Our goal at the time for the MVP was to allow users to easily share what they thought was interesting and possibly use that information to help curate more relevant results.
