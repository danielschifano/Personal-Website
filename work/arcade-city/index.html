      The Problem
    </h2>
    <p class="ma0 f4 fw4 lh-copy pt4">
      Arcade City came to Rangle for help in building a minimum viable product. They had the idea that they wanted to enter the ride-sharing services market in Austin TX with a peer-to-peer solution. The product would be a decentralized marketplace with a heavy focus towards gamification. The marketplace would be by invite only, and new users would be invited by existing users. Karma Points are awarded/removed for good and bad behavior. This Karma system is designed to provide all users with a better idea of who they are sharing a vehicle with, and encourage the good behavior of all users of the product.
      <br>
      <br>
      Unfortunately this would be a very large task to create something of this caliber in the time allotted. This was an MVP to be delivered in a short time frame, requiring a strong focus on minimal features with the highest value/priority. To mitigate risk, it was important to get a working product as soon as possible and iterate against working software until the release date. As such, some features were implemented in a simpler manner to ensure getting to market quicker. We decided to turn our focus to these following areas.
      <br>
      <br>
      1. Registering users on the platform
      <br>
      2. Connecting Travelers with Drivers
      <br>
      3. Facilitating payments between drivers and travelers.

      My role for this engagement was to work with a fellow Product Designer to understand the current competitive landscape and build a product that would rival other ridesharing monoliths. We would work with a team full of experienced developers we got to work quickly by performing a lean competitive analysis of the current market landscape.

      First steps were to identify who our competitors were and how we could differ from their product. This led us to analyze the application from key areas of interaction. We began with exploring the driver experience. These key areas of interaction for the driver user were:
      <br>
      <br>
      1. Drive home
      <br>
      2. Online waiting for requests
      <br>
      3. Getting requests
      <br>
      4. Traveling to a rider
      <br>
      5. Waiting for the rider to get in the vehicle
      <br>
      6. Travel to destination
      <br>
      <br>
			After we outlined the key goals for the driver we did the same for the rider user. Their key areas of interaction were:
      <br>
      <br>
      1. Rider home
      <br>
      2. When the driver is on route
      <br>
      3. On Trip
      <br>
      <br>
			Many products have a product team focusing on one key user whether that be a customer or IT. In this case we had to think about two entirely different users that have seperate motivations

      Once we decided that we had key goals defined for every flow in the application, we began prototyping. The rider flow allows the user to set a pickup location, set pickup details and request a ride. Riders can easily become drivers as well and that is easily accessible through the menu.
      <br>
      <br>
      The driver flow allows the user to go online and offline, to accept or ignore incoming requests and to be able to notify the rider that they are on their way to the pickup location.
