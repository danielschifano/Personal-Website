    The Problem
  </h2>
  <p class="ma0 f5 fw4 lh-paragraph">
    Brookfield approached us to help build a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) broker mobile and portal solution, focused on key improvements to the existing experience and results in large gains in user experience and repeat use.
    <br>
    The reasoning was so they could gain meaningful market share for their valuation solutions in the independent broker market segment. This is part of a larger strategic mandate, which helps Brookfield RPS meet its growth, partnership and innovation objectives.
    <br>
    <br>
    We were tasked with addressing the following issues within the existing platform, which are value to users
    <br>
    <br>
    1. Simpler sign-in and registration
    <br>
    2. Quick, automated and frictionless appraisal ordering
    <br>
    3. Easy payment and adjustments
    <br>
    4. Added data and analytics features and solutions
    <br>
    5. Better communication and notifications
    <br>
    <br>
    Unfortunately we only had several weeks and couldn't tackle all these issues. It was decided that we focus our time on creating a quick, automated and frictionless appraisal ordering system.

    Team & Role
  </h2>
  <p class="ma0 f5 fw4 lh-paragraph">
    My role for this engagement was to quickly understand the current competitive landscape and to create concepts that would help create a better user experience while ordering an appraisal. This meant drawing up a quick analysis of different touch points through the application and how we can approve and creating some high fidelity concepts that showcase a quicker form.

    Prototypes
  </h2>
  <p class="ma0 f5 fw4 lh-paragraph">
    My prototypes focuded on having a single page form that would build as the user was creating their order. On the right side it featured a container that had all user inputs. It acted almost like a receipt. If the user were to click on an input that they had filled out they would be brought to that exact place within the appraisal order.
    <br>
    <br>
    This allowed users to quickly fill out an appraisal form but also have the freedom to access past inputs without worrying about how many times they would have to press back or where they were within the process.

    When a user presses continue they are able to move onto the next part of the form. If they choose to select anythign within the order details they will be brought to that part within the form.

    The order details on the side acts as a receipt. The user can interact with each item and can also clear their entire order to start again. The order details will build in real time as the user completes the form.
